CSL 5.0 README

This directory contains the source code and documentation for the  CREATE Signal 
Library (CSL, pronounced "sizzle," previously called the  CREATE Oscillator, CO). 
CSL is being developed at the Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology 
(CREATE) and the Graduate Program in Media Arts and Technology (MAT) at the 
University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). It is a work in progress.

This is release 5.2, November, 2012.

The home page for CSL is http://FASTLabInc.com/CSL.

CSL is known to work on Mac OSX, many flavors of UNIX/Linux, iPhones, and (with 
limited features) on MS-Windows. To get started quickly, build the JUCE demo app
and use the combo boxes at the bottom to select among the tests, whose source code
is all in the Tests folder. For the Mac, use the XCode project in the CSL_JUCE folder; 
for Linux, use the premake script in the Linux folder. Both assume JUCE 2.0 is 
already installed and compiled.

About CSL

CSL is a C++ class library, to use it, you write and compile C++ programs like 
the ones in the CSL/Tests directory. These programs will generally use the CSL 
class library, and may read input files or respond to in-coming MIDI or OSC 
commands. CSL apps can run stand-alone as servers, or have interactive GUIs, or be 
plug-ins to out-board signal processing tools.

This means that the target users for CSL are C++ programmers (familiar with the 
development tools of their platforms, e.g., Xcode on the Mac, Eclipse on Linux, or 
Visual Studio on MS-Windows) who also know some software sound synthesis language 
such as Csound or SuperCollider (see Curtis Roads' "Computer Music Tutorial").

CSL assumes it's installed in the folder ~/Code/CSL; there are some default settings 
in CSL/Kernel/CSL_Types.h that have to be changed if you put it somewhere else.
The system assumes JUCE is in ~/Code/juce (../juce from the root of the CSL hierarchy).

The best way to get started is to look at the Doxygen-generated API documentation in 
	./Doc/html.zip

You can untar this file to get the full HTML doc and to print out and study the files,
	CSL/Kernel/CSL_Types.h (note the system defaults here)
	CSL/Kernel/CSL_Core.h (the kernel classes are here)
and 
	CSL/Sources/SimpleSines.{h,cpp} (a tutorial for writing unit generators)
or
	CSL/Tests/TestSources.cpp (or any of the other tests)

To compile the sources, you will need to create the links in the CSL/Includes folder; 
to do this, open a UNIX shell (AKA terminal) and execute the commands,

### change to the Includes folder
	cd ~/Code/CSL/CSL/Includes

### make symbolic links from the include files to this folder
	./remake

Note that the release contains a number of files that have not been ported to the 
newest framework; these are generally in subdirectories called "OLD" and may well 
work with a little bit of tweaking; all the really unstable code has been removed.


Platform Requirements

	MacOS X: OS x 10.5 or newer with Xcode 3

	Linux: Tested on Ubuntu 9.04 with X11-libs, ALSA, Freetype, pthreads, openGL/GLUT

	MS-windows: Tested on XP with DirectX 9, ASIO4All, ASIO SDK

	All: JUCE 1.50 (patched audio file IO)


Linking with the CSL Libraries

To link CSL programs, you'll need the following packages installed on your machine:
  Either
	JUCE: Cross-platform everything -- http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com
	Note that we use a version of the JUCE 1.50 libraries with a few extra hooks;
	see the CSL download page and install the changed C++ files in 
	{JUCE}/src/juce_appframework/audio/audio_file_formats.

  OR
	Cross-platform audio I/O: PortAudio (http://www.portaudio.com) V19 or newer;
	Cross-platform MIDI I/O: PortMIDI (http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~music/portmusic);
	Cross-platform sound file I/O: libsndfile 
	(http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile) V1.04 or newer; 
	Fast Fourier Transform: FFTW (http://www.fftw.org) package V3.X;

Note that you can use "vanilla" JUCE for the GUI and IO, but libSndFile for sound file 
API if you don't want to patch your JUCE (compile-time option -DUSE_LSND).

The auralizer (obsolete) also requires 
	VRML parser: libcX3D (http://www.cybergarage.org/vrml/cx3d/cx3dcc/index.html)
	(cd CyberX3D; ./bootstrap; ./configure; make)

To use OpenSoundControl (OSC) with CSL, you'll need liblo (http://liblo.sourceforge.net/), 
which is included in  the CSL source folder.

The CREATE CSL web site includes pre-compiled versions of these libraries for 
Mac OS X and MS-Windows.

If you use FFTW (rather than FFTReal),it needs to be compiled in the way described 
in Sources/Spectral.h.


CSL JUCE demo

Building CSL

	On a Mac: ~/CSL/MacOSX/CSL_JUCE.xcodeproj
	On MS-Windows: ~/CSL/Windows/VS8/CSL.sln
	On Linux: cd ~/CSL/Linux; ./runpremake; make

The new standard way of running CSL programs is using the JUCE GUI. 
Take a look at the projects for Mac/Linux/Windows; we create a window with a couple 
of VU meters and oscilloscopes and combo boxes to select a test suite and specific test 
to run. Note that you need JUCE V 1.50 or newer, and that we use several extensions 
to the sound file I/O classes that can be grabbed from the CSL download site.

The source code for all these tests is in the CSL/Tests directory (and in a"Test" 
file group in the IDE); it's a good way to learn CSL to run the JUCE demo in an 
XCode/Eclipse/VisualStudio debugger and set breakpoints in the test functions 
while using the GUI.


CSL main() functions

Note that there are several versions of the main() function; if you're not using
one of the prepared project files, try compiling the library (most of the sources)
with the file Beep_main.cpp as the main. Alternatively, take a look at the bottom 
of Test_Oscillators.cpp (or Test_Sources.cpp) and select a couple of tests to run.

Test targets
	Beep_Test -- simplest FM beep
	CSL_Test -- basic test suite; uses Test_main.cpp
	OSC_Test -- Several; OSC tests, see OSC_main.cpp
	MIDI_Test -- Reads MIDI in
	CSL Client_Server -- compiles 2 executables for remote c/s streaming


Source Code Organization

The subdirectories of CSL are reflected in the project file categories:

	¥ Tests - Test/demo main() driver functions
	¥ Kernel - Bufers and FrameStreams
	¥ Sources - Oscillators, noise, envelopes, PhysMod
	¥ Processors - Operators, filters, mixers, panners
	¥ IO - IO drivers and LAN streaming
	¥ Utilities - Thread and buffer support classes
	¥ Instruments - OSC/MIDI instrument wrappers
	¥ Spatializers - Panners and spatializers
	¥ Doc - a few published papers, Doxygen doc, README, etc.
	¥ Data - Test sounds, HRTF data, etc.

Reading the source

	Set tabs to 4 spaces so comments line up.
	Use a syntax-coloring editor, if available.
	Note the naming conventions.

Coding Conventions

Naming
	Class, member, and method names are written in "camelCase" as in 
	"UnitGenerator."
	Data members (instance variables) are written with initial "m" followed by 
	embedded caps as in "mOffset."
	Enumeration constants are written with initial "k" followed by embedded caps 
	as in "kDone."

Privacy
	In general data members are protected and have accessor functions where 
	appropriate. 
	The one exception is Buffer which is considered a record class and has public 
	members.
